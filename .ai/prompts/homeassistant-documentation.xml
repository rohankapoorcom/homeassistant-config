  <name>Home Assistant Configuration Documentation</name>
  <description>
    A comprehensive prompt for documenting Home Assistant automations, configurations, and packages.
    This prompt helps create detailed, structured documentation for Home Assistant setups.
  </description>
  
  <context>
    You are documenting a Home Assistant configuration repository. The repository contains:
    - Main configuration files (configuration.yaml, automations.yaml, scripts.yaml)
    - Package-based organization in the packages/ directory
    - Custom components, blueprints, and themes
    - Dashboard configurations and custom Lovelace cards
    - Python scripts and shell commands
    - Various integrations and automations
    
    The goal is to create clear, maintainable documentation that explains:
    1. What each automation/configuration does
    2. How different components interact
    3. The purpose and functionality of each package
    4. Integration details and dependencies
    5. Custom components and their usage
    6. Overall project structure and architecture
  </context>
  
  <instructions>
    When documenting Home Assistant configurations, follow these guidelines:
    
    1. **Structure and Organization**:
       - Use clear headings and subheadings
       - Group related functionality together
       - Include file paths and references
       - Maintain consistency in formatting
    
    2. **Content Requirements**:
       - Explain the purpose and functionality of each component
       - Document triggers, conditions, and actions for automations
       - Describe integration configurations and their settings
       - Include device information and capabilities
       - Explain custom components and their usage
       - Document dashboard layouts and custom cards
    
    3. **Technical Details**:
       - Include YAML code blocks where relevant
       - Reference entity IDs and their purposes
       - Document template sensors and their logic
       - Explain MQTT topics and payloads
       - Include automation IDs and their functions
    
    4. **User Experience**:
       - Write in clear, accessible language
       - Include practical examples and use cases
       - Document troubleshooting steps where applicable
       - Explain the user interface and controls
    
    5. **Maintenance**:
       - Include version information and dependencies
       - Document configuration changes and migrations
       - Provide backup and restore procedures
       - Include testing and validation steps
    
    6. **Documentation Preferences**:
       - Always preserve and include dashboard screenshots when present
       - Do NOT include installation and setup instructions unless specifically requested
       - Emphasize the showcase/portfolio nature of the configuration
       - Focus on documenting what the system does rather than how to replicate it
       - Include blueprint source URLs and GitHub links when available
       - Maintain alphabetical ordering in all lists
       - Only document blueprints created by the repository owner (username should match)
       - Include links for all software stack components to their homepages or GitHub repositories
       - Include links for all custom integrations to their homepages or GitHub repositories
       - Include links for all custom Lovelace cards to their homepages or GitHub repositories
       - Include direct links to custom blueprints within the repository
       - Create "Import Blueprint" buttons using My Home Assistant link generator at https://my.home-assistant.io/create-link/?redirect=blueprint_import
       - For each blueprint, generate an import link by providing the blueprint URL and copying the resulting markdown button
       - Include the import button prominently in each blueprint's documentation
       - Search HACS default integration list at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hacs/default/refs/heads/master/integration for custom integration source repositories
       - Search HACS default plugin list at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hacs/default/refs/heads/master/plugin for custom Lovelace card source repositories
       - For components not found in HACS default lists, link to the repository owner's custom_components or www/community directories
       - Store each blueprint's documentation in a separate file for better organization and maintainability
       - Use descriptive filenames for blueprint documentation files (e.g., "emulated-roku-blueprint.md", "inovelli-lzw30-red-series-switch-blueprint.md")
       - Create an index file that links to all individual blueprint documentation files
       - Organize blueprint documentation files by blueprint type (automation, script, template) rather than by device categories
    
    6. **Blueprint Documentation Organization**:
       - Create individual documentation files for each blueprint
       - Use consistent naming convention: `{blueprint-name}-blueprint.md`
       - Organize files in subdirectories by blueprint type (e.g., `automation/`, `script/`, `template/`)
       - Include a main index file (`README.md`) that provides navigation to all blueprint documentation
       - Create type-specific index files for better organization
       - Include cross-references between related blueprints
       - Maintain a comprehensive summary table in the main index
       - Within each type directory, organize blueprints alphabetically or by functionality
       - Include device-specific information in the individual blueprint documentation rather than in directory structure
       - Include "Import Blueprint" button prominently in each blueprint's documentation
       - Generate import buttons using My Home Assistant link generator for easy blueprint installation
    
    7. **Project Overview**:
       - Document the overall architecture and structure
       - List and categorize all custom integrations
       - List and categorize all custom Lovelace cards
       - List and categorize all custom blueprints (only those created by the repository owner)
       - Explain the package organization system
       - Document the dashboard structure and layout
       - Verify source repositories by checking HACS default integration and plugin lists

        # Motion Light Blueprint Documentation
        
        ## Overview
        A customizable blueprint for creating motion-activated lighting automations. This blueprint turns on lights when motion is detected and automatically turns them off after a specified delay when no motion is detected.
        
        ## Blueprint Information
        - **Name**: Motion-activated Light
        - **Domain**: automation
        - **Source URL**: https://github.com/rohankapoorcom/homeassistant-config/blob/master/blueprints/automation/rohankapoorcom/motion_light.yaml
        - **Author**: rohankapoorcom
        
        ## Input Parameters
        - `motion_entity`: Motion sensor entity (binary_sensor with device_class: motion)
        - `light_target`: Light entity to control
        - `no_motion_wait`: Time to wait after last motion before turning off light (default: 120 seconds)
        
        ## Functionality
        This blueprint creates an automation that:
        - Monitors a motion sensor for state changes
        - Turns on the specified light when motion is detected
        - Waits for motion to stop, then delays for the specified time
        - Automatically turns off the light after the delay period
        - Handles multiple motion events during the delay period
        
        ## Usage Examples
        ```yaml
        # Example: Hallway motion light
        - use_blueprint:
            source_url: https://github.com/rohankapoorcom/homeassistant-config/blob/master/blueprints/automation/rohankapoorcom/motion_light.yaml
            input:
              motion_entity: binary_sensor.hallway_motion
              light_target: light.hallway_lights
              no_motion_wait: 180
        ```
        
        ## Dependencies
