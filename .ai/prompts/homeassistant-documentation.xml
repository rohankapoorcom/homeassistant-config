    A comprehensive prompt for documenting Home Assistant automations, configurations, and packages.
    This prompt helps create detailed, structured documentation for Home Assistant setups.
  </description>
  
  <context>
    You are documenting a Home Assistant configuration repository. The repository contains:
    - Main configuration files (configuration.yaml, automations.yaml, scripts.yaml)
    - Package-based organization in the packages/ directory
    - Custom components, blueprints, and themes
    - Dashboard configurations and custom Lovelace cards
    - Python scripts and shell commands
    - Various integrations and automations
    
    The goal is to create clear, maintainable documentation that explains:
    1. What each automation/configuration does
    2. How different components interact
    3. The purpose and functionality of each package
    4. Integration details and dependencies
    5. Custom components and their usage
    6. Overall project structure and architecture
  </context>
  
  <instructions>
    When documenting Home Assistant configurations, follow these guidelines:
    
    0. **CRITICAL - Documentation Preservation**:
       - **ALWAYS preserve existing documentation structure, format, and style when updating**
       - **ONLY update documentation where actual changes have occurred in the codebase**
       - **DO NOT overwrite existing documentation with new templates unless explicitly requested**
       - **Maintain the original documentation's tone, formatting, and organizational structure**
       - **When updating existing files, make minimal changes and preserve the original content style**
       - **Before making any documentation changes, analyze existing documentation to understand current state**
       - **Use git history to understand original documentation style if needed**
    
    1. **Structure and Organization**:
       - Use clear headings and subheadings
       - Group related functionality together
       - Include file paths and references

    6. **Documentation Preferences**:
       - **CRITICAL**: Always preserve existing documentation structure, format, and style when updating
       - **CRITICAL**: Only update documentation where actual changes have occurred in the codebase
       - **CRITICAL**: Do NOT overwrite existing documentation with new templates unless explicitly requested
       - **CRITICAL**: Maintain the original documentation's tone, formatting, and organizational structure
       - **CRITICAL**: When updating existing files, make minimal changes and preserve the original content style
       - Always preserve and include dashboard screenshots when present
       - Do NOT include installation and setup instructions unless specifically requested
       - Emphasize the showcase/portfolio nature of the configuration
       - Focus on documenting what the system does rather than how to replicate it
       - Include blueprint source URLs and GitHub links when available
       - Maintain alphabetical ordering in all lists
       - Only document blueprints created by the repository owner (username should match)
       - Include links for all software stack components to their homepages or GitHub repositories
       - Include links for all custom integrations to their homepages or GitHub repositories
       - Include links for all custom Lovelace cards to their homepages or GitHub repositories
       - Include direct links to custom blueprints within the repository
       - Create "Import Blueprint" buttons using My Home Assistant link generator at https://my.home-assistant.io/create-link/?redirect=blueprint_import
       - For each blueprint, generate an import link by providing the blueprint URL and copying the resulting markdown button
       - Include the import button prominently in each blueprint's documentation
       - Search HACS default integration list at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hacs/default/refs/heads/master/integration for custom integration source repositories
       - Search HACS default plugin list at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hacs/default/refs/heads/master/plugin for custom Lovelace card source repositories
       - For components not found in HACS default lists, link to the repository owner's custom_components or www/community directories
       - Store each blueprint's documentation in a separate file for better organization and maintainability
       - Use descriptive filenames for blueprint documentation files (e.g., "emulated-roku-blueprint.md", "inovelli-lzw30-red-series-switch-blueprint.md")
       - Create an index file that links to all individual blueprint documentation files
       - Organize blueprint documentation files by blueprint type (automation, script, template) rather than by device categories
       - **CRITICAL**: Create comprehensive documentation for ALL packages in the packages/ directory
       - **CRITICAL**: Create comprehensive documentation for ALL automations in automations.yaml and package files
       - **CRITICAL**: Create package documentation files in docs/packages/ directory
       - **CRITICAL**: Create automation documentation files in docs/automations/ directory
       - **CRITICAL**: Use correct relative link patterns: docs/packages/ and docs/automations/ use ../../README.md, docs/blueprints/ subdirectories use ../README.md, individual blueprint files use ../README.md (links to blueprint index)
       
    6a. **Link Validation and Directory Structure**:
       - **CRITICAL**: Before creating or updating any documentation links, verify the target files exist in the correct directory structure
       - **CRITICAL**: Always check directory structure before creating relative links to prevent broken links
       - **CRITICAL**: Use the following directory structure validation process:
         1. List directory contents to verify file locations
         2. Check relative path calculations from source to target directories
         3. Verify all referenced files exist before creating links
         4. Test link paths using proper relative navigation patterns
       - **CRITICAL**: Follow this directory structure and link pattern guide:
         - Main repository root: Contains README.md, packages/, docs/, blueprints/, etc.
         - docs/packages/: Contains individual package documentation files (e.g., security.md, office.md)
         - docs/automations/: Contains automation documentation files and README.md index
         - docs/blueprints/: Contains blueprint documentation organized by type
         - From docs/packages/ to main README: ../../README.md
         - From docs/automations/ to main README: ../../README.md
         - From docs/packages/ to docs/automations/: ../automations/README.md
         - From docs/automations/ to docs/packages/: ../packages/[filename].md
         - From docs/blueprints/ to main README: ../../README.md
         - From docs/blueprints/ subdirectories to blueprint index: ../README.md
         - From individual blueprint files to blueprint index: ../README.md
       - **CRITICAL**: When updating documentation, always verify existing links are still valid
       - **CRITICAL**: If moving files or changing directory structure, update ALL affected links
       - **CRITICAL**: Use tools to validate links after making changes (e.g., grep, ls, file existence checks)
       - **CRITICAL**: Never assume file locations - always verify before creating links
       - **CRITICAL**: When creating documentation index files, verify all referenced files exist
       - **CRITICAL**: Include link validation as part of documentation review process
    
    6. **Blueprint Documentation Organization**:
       - Create individual documentation files for each blueprint
       - Use consistent naming convention: `{blueprint-name}-blueprint.md`
       - Organize files in subdirectories by blueprint type (e.g., `automation/`, `script/`, `template/`)
       - Include a main index file (`README.md`) that provides navigation to all blueprint documentation
       - Create type-specific index files for better organization
       - Include cross-references between related blueprints
       - Maintain a comprehensive summary table in the main index
       - Within each type directory, organize blueprints alphabetically or by functionality
       - Include device-specific information in the individual blueprint documentation rather than in directory structure
       - Include "Import Blueprint" button prominently in each blueprint's documentation
       - Generate import buttons using My Home Assistant link generator for easy blueprint installation
    
    7. **Project Overview**:
       - Document the overall architecture and structure
       - List and categorize all custom integrations
       - List and categorize all custom Lovelace cards
       - List and categorize all custom blueprints (only those created by the repository owner)
       - Explain the package organization system
       - Document the dashboard structure and layout
       - Verify source repositories by checking HACS default integration and plugin lists
       - **CRITICAL**: Create comprehensive documentation for ALL packages and their functionality
       - **CRITICAL**: Create comprehensive documentation for ALL automations and their purposes
       - **CRITICAL**: Document the main configuration structure and organization
       - **CRITICAL**: Check www/community/ directory to ensure ALL custom Lovelace cards are documented
       - **CRITICAL**: Verify custom Lovelace card GitHub links are correct and up-to-date
       
    8. **Documentation Structure Requirements**:
       - **CRITICAL**: Create docs/packages/ directory with individual package documentation files
       - **CRITICAL**: Create docs/automations/ directory with individual automation documentation files
       - **CRITICAL**: Create main documentation index files for each directory
       - **CRITICAL**: Ensure every package in packages/ directory has corresponding documentation
       - **CRITICAL**: Ensure every automation in automations.yaml and package files has documentation
       - **CRITICAL**: Create cross-references between related documentation files
       - **CRITICAL**: Include links to individual package documentation files in the Package Organization section of README.md
       - **CRITICAL**: Verify all custom Lovelace cards in www/community/ directory are documented in README.md
       - **CRITICAL**: Ensure all custom Lovelace card GitHub links are correct and point to the actual repository
       - **CRITICAL**: Verify all internal documentation links are correct and functional
       - **CRITICAL**: Test all relative links from different directory levels to ensure proper path resolution
       - **CRITICAL**: Follow correct link patterns: docs/packages/ and docs/automations/ use ../../README.md, docs/blueprints/ subdirectories use ../README.md, individual blueprint files use ../README.md (links to blueprint index)
    
    8a. **Link Validation Workflow**:
       - **CRITICAL**: Before creating any documentation links, follow this validation workflow:
         1. Use `list_dir` tool to verify directory structure and file locations
         2. Use `grep` tool to search for existing link patterns in documentation
         3. Use `run_terminal_cmd` with `ls` commands to verify file existence
         4. Calculate relative paths manually and verify they resolve correctly
         5. Test link paths by checking if target files exist at calculated locations
       - **CRITICAL**: When updating existing documentation with links:
         1. First, identify all existing links in the file using grep
         2. Check if each referenced file exists in the expected location
         3. Verify directory structure hasn't changed since links were created
         4. Update broken links to point to correct file locations
         5. Validate all new links before finalizing documentation
       - **CRITICAL**: Use these specific tools for link validation:
         - `list_dir` to check directory contents and structure
         - `grep` to find existing links and patterns in documentation
         - `run_terminal_cmd` with `ls` to verify file existence
         - `read_file` to check if referenced files contain expected content
       - **CRITICAL**: Never create links without first verifying target files exist
       - **CRITICAL**: Always test relative path calculations from source to target directories
       - **CRITICAL**: Include link validation as a mandatory step in any documentation update process

        # Motion Light Blueprint Documentation
        
        ## Overview
        A customizable blueprint for creating motion-activated lighting automations. This blueprint turns on lights when motion is detected and automatically turns them off after a specified delay when no motion is detected.
        
        ## Blueprint Information
        - **Name**: Motion-activated Light
        - **Domain**: automation
        - **Source URL**: https://github.com/rohankapoorcom/homeassistant-config/blob/master/blueprints/automation/rohankapoorcom/motion_light.yaml
        - **Author**: rohankapoorcom
        
        ## Input Parameters
        - `motion_entity`: Motion sensor entity (binary_sensor with device_class: motion)
        - `light_target`: Light entity to control
        - `no_motion_wait`: Time to wait after last motion before turning off light (default: 120 seconds)
        
        ## Functionality
        This blueprint creates an automation that:
        - Monitors a motion sensor for state changes
        - Turns on the specified light when motion is detected
        - Waits for motion to stop, then delays for the specified time
        - Automatically turns off the light after the delay period
        - Handles multiple motion events during the delay period
        
        ## Usage Examples
        ```yaml
        # Example: Hallway motion light
        - use_blueprint:
            source_url: https://github.com/rohankapoorcom/homeassistant-config/blob/master/blueprints/automation/rohankapoorcom/motion_light.yaml
            input:
              motion_entity: binary_sensor.hallway_motion
              light_target: light.hallway_lights
              no_motion_wait: 180
        ```
