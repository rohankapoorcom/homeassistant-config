## Project Agent Guidelines

This repository uses Cursor Project Rules to ensure consistent behavior from coding assistants.

- Primary rules live in `RULES.md`.
- Assistants should treat `RULES.md` as authoritative for Home Assistant config standards, security, testing, and documentation.

For full details, see `RULES.md`.
