## Automation Patterns

### Blueprint Usage
Many automations use custom blueprints for device-specific functionality:
- **Inovelli Switches**: Lock status indicators and scene controls
- **Motion Lighting**: Automated lighting based on motion detection
- **Lock Controls**: Coordinated lock and lighting automation
- **Battery Monitoring**: Battery level detection and notifications

### Template Sensors
Complex state tracking and calculations:
- **Lighting States**: Binary sensors for lighting preset states
- **Fan Speeds**: Percentage-based fan speed tracking
- **Occupancy Logic**: Complex occupancy detection algorithms

### Event-Driven Automation
Automations triggered by state changes and events:
- **Motion Detection**: Motion sensor state changes
- **Lock Status**: Lock state changes
- **Occupancy Changes**: Presence detection events
- **Weather Events**: Weather condition changes

### Occupancy-Based Control
Intelligent automation based on room occupancy:
- **Lighting Control**: Automatic lighting based on occupancy
- **Equipment Management**: Power management for equipment
- **Climate Control**: Temperature and fan control
- **Security**: Security system activation/deactivation

## Common Automation Types

### Lighting Automation
- **Motion-Activated**: Lights turn on/off based on motion detection
- **Occupancy-Based**: Lighting control based on room occupancy
- **Preset Control**: Brightness presets (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
- **Scene Control**: Coordinated lighting scenes via Z-Wave switches

### Security Automation
- **Lock Status Indicators**: Visual lock status on Z-Wave switches
- **Emergency Response**: Automatic emergency service dispatch
- **Glass Break Sensors**: Battery-saving sensor management
- **Access Control**: Coordinated lighting for entry/exit

### Climate Control
- **Fan Speed Control**: Percentage-based fan speed management
- **Temperature Monitoring**: Real-time temperature tracking
- **Humidity Control**: Humidity monitoring and alerts
- **Air Quality**: Air quality monitoring and notifications

### Entertainment Automation
- **Audio Control**: Whole-home audio system management
- **Harmony Integration**: Logitech Harmony remote control
- **Media Synchronization**: Coordinated media playback
- **Volume Management**: Centralized volume control

## Automation Dependencies

### Common Dependencies
- **Z-Wave JS**: Device communication and control
- **MQTT**: Message queuing and device discovery
- **Template Sensors**: Complex state calculations
- **Custom Blueprints**: Automation templates for specific devices

### Integration Dependencies
- **Harmony**: Entertainment system control
- **Alarmo**: Advanced alarm system
- **Noonlight**: Emergency response
- **Ring**: Alarm system integration
- **Adaptive Lighting**: Lighting automation

## Usage Guidelines

### Automation Configuration
- Each automation includes unique ID and descriptive alias
- Automations use clear descriptions explaining their purpose
- Mode settings (single, restart, queued) are specified appropriately
- Error handling and timeout configurations are included

### Best Practices
- **Descriptive Names**: Automation aliases clearly describe functionality
- **Unique IDs**: Each automation has a unique identifier
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation for each automation
- **Testing**: Automation testing and validation procedures
- **Maintenance**: Regular review and optimization of automation logic
